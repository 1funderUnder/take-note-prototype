This progressive web app is a music practice app designed to help music lovers keep track of their practice sessions. Use it to monitor your weekly goals
and challenge yourself to practice more each day. Here are a few things you can do with the app:
1. Log practice sessions with date and amount of time spent
2. Track progress towards goals
3. Keep track of songs you'd like to learn later
4. Practice anywhere, anytime with offline capabilities

Instructions for viewing:
Since the app is not hosted online, you will need to run it locally on your computer.
To ensure the best viewing experience, you should run it using a local server:
1. Download and extract the repository.
2. Open the folders in VS Code or your preferred code editor
3. Either install a live server extension in your code editor and click "Go Live" to launch the app, or
4. Enter your local host URL to view the file (this will vary depending on which code editor you are using. You can look at the terminal output to find the correct one.)

Alternatively, you may download the files onto your computer and open the index.html file in your browser. In this case, some of the PWA features, such as offline caching may not work properly.
